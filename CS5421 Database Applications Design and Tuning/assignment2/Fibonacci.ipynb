    "The read committed level allows a transaction to see only data committed before the transaction begins. A transaction can also see changes made by other transactions that commit while the transaction is still in progress. This level prevents dirty reads, but not non-repeatable reads or phantom reads.\n",
    "\n",
    "The repeatable read level transaction operates with a snapshot of the database taken at the start of the transaction. It prevents dirty and non-repeatable reads, ensuring that all reads within a transaction see a consistent database snapshot. However, it does not always prevent phantom reads.\n",

This level prevents dirty, non-repeatable, and phantom reads, ensuring total isolation from other transactions.\n",
