This assignment is constructed by adapting the build scripts and PTF examples that are publicly available at [p4-guide](https://github.com/jafingerhut/p4-guide) by Andy Fingerhut. 

In addition, we also adapt existing scripts and tools from p4lang's [P4 Tutorials](https://github.com/p4lang/tutorials/tree/master) which made it easy to create new exercises.
